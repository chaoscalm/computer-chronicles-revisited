I've been a professional writer for over 20 years, and after spending most of that time focusing on the law, I decided to launch *Computer Chronicles Revisited* as a long-term blog project to look at the history of the computer industry from the perspective of the people who helped to shape it during the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.

*Computer Chronicles* was a weekly television series that initially aired on public broadcasting stations in the United States from 1983 to 2002. Over the course of more than 460 episodes, "Chronicles" featured thousands of guests and products from the computer industry. My blog reviews the series one episode at a time and tries to provide additional context for the people and products who were featured. What ever happened to the guests? Were the products successful? And if not, why was that the case?

As of March 2022, I've already reviewed the first two seasons of *Chronicles* and am now working my way through the third season, which first aired in 1985-1986. But there's more than 17 seasons left to go. With support from readers such as yourself, I can expand my coverage to include additional "special" posts that go depper into specific subjects covered in a particular episode.

As with many blogs, this is a one-person effort. I've enjoyed working on *Computer Chronicles Revisited* as a personal project and plan to keep it that way. But I also know that there is a large community of people interested in retro computing and the history of computers. So I'm hoping some of you will be able to contribute, either through a [one-time PayPal donation](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=FRAX5XBRTFEGA) or by [joining my Patreon](https://patreon.com/chronrevisited), to help pay for my costs and time in producing this blog. Thanks in advance for reading this far and I hope to meet you soon through Patreon!
